# PostProccess-PDR: Post-Processing for Pedestrian Dead Reckoning

A post-processing toolkit for refining the accuracy of Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) systems by analyzing and adjusting the trajectory data.

## Overview

PostProccess-PDR is designed to enhance the precision of PDR systems. It applies various post-processing techniques to the raw trajectory data obtained from sensors, such as IMUs, to correct systematic errors and improve overall navigation accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Trajectory Refinement**: Applies algorithms to smooth and adjust the trajectory data.
- **Error Correction**: Identifies and corrects systematic errors in the PDR data.
- **Data Analysis**: Provides tools for detailed analysis of PDR data quality.
- **Open Source**: Encourages community contributions and transparent development.

## Getting Started

To begin using PostProccess-PDR, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
